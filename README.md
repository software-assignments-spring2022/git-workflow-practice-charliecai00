<h3>README.md </h3>

<p>https://learnxinyminutes.com/ is a website that I find interesting related to software development. </p>
<p>As a Software Engineer, we are always at the position to learn new technologies. The good news is many language has the root to C and Unix, which means many language shares a similar basic concept and syntax. Even we can easily transfer our skills to other languages, there are still many unknowns. Websites like Learn X in Y Minutes can assist us with the transition.</p>
<p>The website contains a comprehensive entry guide to many common and less known languages and libraries. Programmers should be able to understand the basic operations of a language upon completing the page reading. </p>
