<h3>README.md </h3>

<p>https://learnxinyminutes.com/ is a website that I find interesting related to software development. </p>
<p>As a Software Engineer, we are always at the position to learn new technologies. The good news is many language has the root to C and Unix, which means many language shares a similar basic concept and syntax. Even we can easily transfer our skills to other languages, there are still many unknowns. Websites like Learn X in Y Minutes can assist us with the transition.</p>
<p>The website contains a comprehensive entry guide to many common and less known languages and libraries. Programmers should be able to understand the basic operations of a language upon completing the page reading. </p>

- Really nice paragraph! --Chengyang Song 

<h3>Edit: Isabelle Oktay</h3>
<p>After browsing the website, I found guides to a bunch of different  programming languages and frameworks that I have always wanted to learn, such as ObjectivC, Ruby, AngularJS, and Bash. Though the UI design is quite simple, I do appreciate how straightforward the website is. A user just browses through all the languages and frameworks on the left-hand column of the front page and chooses which one they want to learn. I also really admired how there were so many different translations of the notes provided.</p>

<p>In order to test out the website, I picked a random language to learn. The language that intrigued me the most was one called LOLCODE, which is supposed to resemble the speech of a popular early 2000s meme called lolcats. All inline comments begin with 'BTW', and in order to declare a variable, you need to type out 'I HAS A ____ ITZ', where ____ is replaced by the type you are declaring. The language is not very practical, but it is very funny.</p>
